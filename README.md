# Lab 4 on Vocal Analysis


## Getting started

Before you start, ensure you have git, spyder, and an SSH key.

(VS Code, python, poetry, gatorgrade are not longer required. The 
tools above are much easier to get and use.)

On GitHub, click on the green button. Copy the SSH link.

In a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to work on these files.
For this you can use the `cd` command. Clone the repo to your computer by typing:

`git clone ` and then the link that you copied.

In Spyder, go to project > new project 

Select existing directory and the directory that you just cloned

Follow along in lab session and check the starter repo README for updates.



This lab is in development, so updates will occur. 




To save your work after changes go to a terminal and navigate to the directory
for this project.

Type:

`git add .`

`git commit -m "Short message about what you have done"`

`git push origin main`

DO NOT USE A MIXTURE OF GIT AND GITHUB EDITING WITHOUT A FRIEND WHO KNOWS HOW
TO MIX THEM AND RESOLVE MERGE CONFLICTS. MY ADVICE IS TO STICK WITH GIT!
